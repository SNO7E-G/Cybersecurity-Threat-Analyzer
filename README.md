    """
    if packet.haslayer(DNS) and packet.qr == 0:  # DNS query
        query = packet[DNSQR].qname.decode()
        if len(query) > 50 and entropy(query) > 4.0:
            return Threat(
                threat_type="Data Exfiltration",
                severity="high",
                confidence=0.85,
                description=f"Potential DNS tunneling detected: {query}"
            )
    return None
```

### Adding New ML Models

```python
# Example of adding a custom ML model
from ml.advanced_algorithms import AdvancedSecurityAlgorithms

# Initialize the advanced algorithms manager
alg_manager = AdvancedSecurityAlgorithms()

# Create and train a custom model
custom_model = alg_manager.get_algorithm('zero_day_detector')
alg_manager.train_model('zero_day_detector', X_train, y_train)

# Use the model for detection
predictions = alg_manager.predict('zero_day_detector', X_test)
```

See `docs/extending_ml.md` for detailed instructions on adding custom ML models.

### Adding Custom Device Support

```python
# Example of registering a custom device profile
from core.device_support import DeviceSupport

device_support = DeviceSupport()

# Define a custom device profile
custom_profile = {
    'name': 'Medical IoT Device',
    'scanning_protocols': ['DICOM', 'HL7', 'MQTT'],
    'monitoring_protocols': ['SNMP', 'Syslog', 'MQTT'],
    'authentication_methods': ['OAuth2', 'Certificate'],
    'vulnerability_scanners': ['Medical-specific', 'General'],
